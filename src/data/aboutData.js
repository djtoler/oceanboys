    title: "Origin of the OceanBoyz Investment Group Name",
    description1:"OceanBoyz Investment Group has its roots in fellowship. A group of African American men who formed a longstanding relationship as children, and have continued to foster and grow those relationships as adults decided to begin investing in the stock market. The name “OceanBoyz” refers to the street in the City of Detroit, Michigan where many of them lived, and that they all hung out on—Pacific (generally referred to by these brothers as “The Ocean”).",
    description2: "In 2019 the decision was made to begin saving, investing for their (and their families) futures in, and educating themselves on the stock market. The OceanBoyz Investment Group was established as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in December of 2019. Though the investment group moniker is a reference to, and testament to the group of brothers who grew up On the Ocean, the group itself is NOT exclusionary, is committed to diversity and inclusion in its composition and future.",
